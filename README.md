## Problem Statement 6: Visualizing Model Performance - Titanic Dataset

This repository is a part of my MLOps practice exercises. The objective of this project is to train two binary classification models on the Titanic dataset, visualize their performance, and compare them.

### Tasks
- Preprocess the Titanic dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables).
- Train two classification models (eg., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, etc.)
- Plot and save Confusion Matrix and Precision-Recall Curve
- Compare both models and explain which one performed better.
- Save all visualizations inside the `results/` directory.

### Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (from Kaggle).
- It includes information about passengers such as:
  - Age, Sex, Fare, Class, Embarkation port, Survival status, etc.
